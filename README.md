# OpenCL-Multiplication-Additon-and-Reduction

Conducts these operations using OpenCL to test the performance of the operation as local and global size scales. Works as intended. All cpp code is in one file by instruciton of the professor for grading purposes. The included bash script executes all three operation choices with varying global and local sizes.
